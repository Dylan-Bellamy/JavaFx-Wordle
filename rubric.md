## Mini Reflection

Name: <Dylan Bellamy>

I think my program is a level <4+> because my code is effective and efficient 
becuase of the use of arrays, dimensional arrays, & for loops making it less code 
than if-then statements. It's also a level 4+ because of the added features such as a keyboard
made from buttons, restart buttons, and win & lose screens. Lastly I believe it a level
4+ because it's aesthetically appealing.

The extra features I included in my program are: 

  - Keyboard (Made from buttons)
  - Enter Key
  - Backspace Key
  - Win Screen
  - Lose Screen
  - Restart Button
